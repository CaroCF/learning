Learning is a repository with all the exercises of Python 3 classes, based on "Introduction to Computer Science Professional Certificate" by Microsoft at edX and "Python 3: A Beginners Guide to Python Programming" by Tony Staunton.

Exercises are compiled in files according to different topics. 
However, I've noticed not in the most user friendly way.

These are simple, basic exercises from both courses, nothing fancy.
